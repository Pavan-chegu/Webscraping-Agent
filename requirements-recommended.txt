# LangChain compatibility
# Choose one of the following options depending on which LangChain major
# version you want to use.

# Option A: LangChain 0.x (monolithic, recommended for older codepaths)
# Uncomment to install the monolithic langchain package:
# langchain<1

# Option B: LangChain 1.x (modular). If you prefer LangChain 1.x install
# the modular packages in addition to the core requirements above:
# langchain_text_splitters
# langchain_community
# langchain_openai
# langchain_groq  # optional, only if you use Groq models

# Notes:
# - If you install LangChain 1.x, you may also need to install provider-specific
#   packages (e.g. langchain_openai or langchain_groq) depending on which LLM
#   provider you use.
# - You can install with: `pip install -r requirements-recommended.txt` and then add the
#   LangChain 1.x modular packages if desired.
